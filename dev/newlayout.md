🔹 Designer Instructions for 
Game Start Screen


Overall Look & Feel

Dark, cinematic background (deep navy / black gradient).

Accent colours inspired by Squid Game:

Hot Pink → for main CTAs (start/play buttons).

Green → highlights for positive states.

Red → warnings / negative states.

White / Grey → text and subtle separators.

Minimal but visually exciting, like a mix between Netflix-style UI and neon gaming vibes.

Must fit on a single iPhone screen (no scrolling).

Layout
Top Bar

Profile avatar (circle) on the left.

Balance (green token badge) on the right.

Centre-aligned title: Red Light Green Light.

Game Mode Selection (Main Focus)

Section title: “Select Game Mode” (with a small game controller icon).

Two mode cards stacked vertically:

Classic Mode (hot pink highlight when selected).

Description: “Pure reaction game – no power-ups, just you vs the light.”

Arcade Mode (Beta) (dark grey background).

Description: “Enhanced gameplay with floating power-ups and special abilities.”

Each card should be compact (not too tall), fitting cleanly on screen with rounded corners and a subtle neon glow effect.

Start Button (Hero CTA)

Large, glowing hot pink button across the screen width.

Label: “Start Game (∞ turns left)”

Small glowing emoji/icon (like 🚦 or 🕹) on each side.

This is the main focal point visually, so it should “pop” (slight 3D effect or glow).

Tagline / Motivation Line (Below CTA)

Short, punchy copy:

“Test your reflexes and nerve – how long can you survive?”

In white/grey text, smaller than the button.

Navigation Bar (Bottom)

Keep the tab bar:

Game | Leaderboard | How To | Settings

Use Apple’s SF Symbols but styled with subtle neon outlines (pink for active tab).

🔹 Key Notes for Designer
Make sure everything fits neatly on a single screen without scrolling.

Hierarchy: Game Mode cards → Big Start Button → Motivation Line.

Use rounded corners, neon glows, and subtle animations (e.g., hover/glow effect when tapping a mode card or button).

The whole vibe should feel dark, cinematic, and tense (like Squid Game), but fun and exciting enough to feel viral.

Keep readability high – no clutter, clean typography.

⚡ This way, when users land on the Start Screen, it feels instantly engaging, polished, and viral-friendly.
